this givenchy powder. i remember actually watching my last vogue video. the amount of powder that i used is just unreal. so i'm gonna do a little bit of powder on here. stormy still doesn't really play with makeup. i love these charlotte tilbury powders. i think that when we're looking for inspo for events and makeup looks, we get inspiration from everywhere like old fashion shows, i'm always on pinterest, and just getting inspiration and how we can make it our own and modern and like a very experimental era with makeup and i'm so willing to try new things and new looks. another secret, i have these amazing obsessed with these cream shadows that are here. you could put this directly on your eye. i'm going for a lighter look, so i'm gonna put it on the palette. a little goes a long way, and they don't dry too fast. so i like that you can play with them for a little. i like to focus on the outer corner of the eye, but also like, i love a dragged out shadow look. this is just a really pretty neutral matte palette for everyday. maybe a little here. when i have products that i really believe in, i want everyone's opinion. i love doing my own makeup because it's just very therapeutic for me. i love to zone out.
